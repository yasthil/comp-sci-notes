# Hash Tables
Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.

# Consequences
When you insert a key/value pair into a hash map, the following occurs:
- A `hash code` is generated based on the key - careful, there may be collisions (more than one hash code generated per key)
- This hash code is then mapped to an index - careful, there may be collisions here too (more than one index generated per index)
- Both the key and value are stored 

# Collisions
A collision occurs when:
- There's more than one hash code per key
- There's more than one index per key hash code

One of the techniques to solve collisions, is called `Chaining`.

## Chaining
- Instead of storing the key/value pairs in an array
- Use a LinkedList to store the key/value pairs
- This means that once you retrieve a value at a given index (based off a hashcode generated by the key), you step through the Linked List until you find the desired value

# C# Implementation
# NB: [Use `Dicionary<TKey, TValue>` instead of Hashtable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.hashtable?view=netcore-3.1)
_We don't recommend that you use the Hashtable class for new development. Instead, we recommend that you use the generic Dictionary<TKey,TValue> class._

## C# `Hashtable`
- Each element is a key/value pair stored in a `DictionaryEntry` object. A key cannot be null, but a value can be.
- The method Add will throw an exception if a new key is already in the hash table
- Use ContainsKey to check before inserting to avoid potential exceptions from duplicates



## Code
```c#
Hashtable students = new Hashtable();
students.Add("Hermione", "Gryffindor");
students.Add("Harry", "Gryffindor");
students.Add("Ron", "Gryffindor");
students.Add("Draco", "Slytherin");

// the method Add will throw an exception if a new key is already in the hash table
try 
{
    students.Add("Harry", "Slytherin");
}
catch
{
    Console.WriteLine("Key already exists");
}

// When you use foreach to enumerate hash table elements,
// the elements are retrieved as KeyValuePair objects.
foreach(DictionaryEntry studentHousePair in students)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Key = {0}, Value = {1}", studentHousePair.Key, studentHousePair.Value);
}

// to retrive a value
Console.WriteLine("House that Harry belongs to: "+ students["Harry"]);

// you can update the value a key is mapped to by assigning it to another value
students["Draco"] = "Hufflepuff";
```
