# Mediator 
Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
* Promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicity
* Lets you vary their interaction independently 


# When to use the Mediator Pattern?
- When you notice that reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects (strong coupling)
